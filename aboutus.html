    <p class="lead"><b>KometCare</b> is an Irish company helps people from overseas to find a job in healthcare sector.
        We help our clients to help find their employers, organise the online interview. Once a candidate is selected by
        an employer, we will then help them get all the necessary papers required for the remaining process to get the
        VISA and travel to Ireland and start working. There is a growing need to healthcare assistants in Ireland. The
        minister said: The Health Service Capacity Review 2018 forecast a 59% increase in the population aged over 65
        and a 95% increase in the population aged over 85 by 2031. Between 2016 to 2031, the number of long-term care
        beds required is estimated to increase by over 10,000 and this additional demand will give rise to demand for
        increased staffing levels. </p>
    <p class="lead">KometCare will be working purely on behalf of the candidate and will always be protecting their
        details. Also, as for the employer we will be working together with all the way through. The candidate will be
        paying the 1000 Euro visa processing fee and the agent commission once the employee had passed the initial
        online interview. Before we start the visa application process the candidate will then need to finish all the
        dues. We will not be taking any fee from the candidate in the event of any failure. Also, the Irish visa
        authority will return the 900 Euro.</p>
